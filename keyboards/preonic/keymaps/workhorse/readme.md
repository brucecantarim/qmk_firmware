## Disclaimer

This layout was created by ***Bruce Cantarim***, as a daily driver for touch typing and general development work.
It means to extend the functionality of preonic with a leader key, along with using the backlight to indicate the current layer / capslock status.
The main changes to the key arrangement is moving the backspace to the capslock position, adding the right shift key, and improving access to special characters used in programming and international languages.

Other challenges that this layout aims to implement is workaround for preonic sound problems with the builtin speaker and music mode.
Haven't dedicated much time into this yet, but it is in my backlog.

This README.md file will be updated with more information and proper documentation once I'm confident about the quality.
At that time, I'll open a PR to the origin project.

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

***For now, feel free to copy these settings and creating your own layout using workhorse as a base.***
